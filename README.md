  ## Description

  This employee tracker database makes it easy for non-developers to view and interact with information stored in the employee tracker database. This app is basically a Content Management System (CMS), where managers can view all of the information about their organization via a simple command-line interface. This app uses node, inquirer, and MySQL to deliver a robust command-line interface to an employee tracking database.
